Automatic enrollment and end of year processing (php needed, but the sql is done... see below, maybe you can script it to run on a set date)
Auto-add brothers and sisters
** Auto-populate sudent accounts (DONE!)
Refactor code to be cleaner, use sessions, and to be more reliable
Add batch processing pages and functions for adding students, and registering payments.


The only tables I'm concerned with right now

enrollment
student accounts



Upon adding a student, check for lastnames. If there is a student with the same last name with a different id, then automatically add a record for a sibling. Have a confirmation page where you make sure they're siblings.

------------

Matricula (rate equivalent; the list of costs that make up matricula)



StudentMatriculaAccount (staccount equivalent; only one total)

StudentMatriculaTransaction (transaction equivalent; checklist of payments. must be scripted such that brothers are exempted from ONE asociacion padres payment)

------------

(Add column "year" to enrollment table)

INSERT INTO enrollment (id, grade, grupo, enr_date, `year`, prev_result, `status`) SELECT id, grade+1, grupo, enr_date, `year`+1, prev_result, `status` FROM `enrollment` WHERE grade < 11 AND status = 1
