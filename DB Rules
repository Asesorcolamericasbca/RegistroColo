Naming conventions:

No plural names, ever.

Tables must be named by the entity it represents, or its function.
If the table represents something descriptive, such as 'previous year status representation', it must be reworked.

If multiple words are needed for a table name, the format will look thus: ''

neither underscore nor dash may be used in primary keys
within column names, 

no names anywhere may permit spaces, or reserved words.
no capitalization is permitted in any names.
no punctuation is permitted in any names.

no special characters are permitted in any names, except for the underscore (_) and dash (-), 
each according to their specification within this ruleset.

dashes in table names mean that the table is in testing phase

The entire database must adhere to a single language, and no slang
